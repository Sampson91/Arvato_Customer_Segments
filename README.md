#  Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

  In this project, I will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany,
comparing it against demographics information for the general population. use use unsupervised learning 
techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core
customer base of the company. Then, I will apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information 
for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to
convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann 
Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task <br>
